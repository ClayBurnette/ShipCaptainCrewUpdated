# Ship Captain Crew
"Ship, Captain, Crew" is a dice game that involves rolling five dice to achieve specific combinations. The goal is to roll the dice in such a way as to get the highest possible score based on certain criteria. Here are the basic rules for the game:

## Objective: 
- The objective of the game is to score the highest possible combination of Ship, Captain, and Crew.

## Equipment: 
- You need five standard six-sided dice to play the game.

## Scoring:
- Ship (6): The die with the number 6 represents the Ship. You need to roll at least one 6 to score in this category.
- Captain (5): The die with the number 5 represents the Captain. You need to roll at least one 5 to score in this category.
- Crew (4): The die with the number 4 represents the Crew. You need to roll at least one 4 to score in this category.
- The remaining two dice: These are not scored individually. Instead, the sum of these two dice contributes to your overall score.

## Rolling:
- On a turn, a player rolls all five dice.
- After the first roll, the player can choose to set aside any combination of 4s, 5s, and 6s and roll the remaining dice again.
- After the second roll, the player can again set aside any combination of 4s, 5s, and 6s and roll the remaining dice for the final time.
- After the third roll, the player records their score based on the rules above.

## Scoring the Game:
- If a player rolls all three of Ship, Captain, and Crew (at least one 4, one 5, and one 6), they achieve the highest possible score.
- If the player doesn't roll all three, they record the sum of the remaining two dice as their score.
- Winning: Players take turns rolling, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

It's a simple yet entertaining dice game that involves a mix of strategy and luck. Players decide when to push their luck by re-rolling to get the desired combination.
